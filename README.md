# IBM-Deep-Learning-edX

In this repo I've uploaded my handwritten notes and all my Jupyter Notebooks, including exercises and Final Exams.

Notes:
- "Deep Learning with Keras" is, in my opinion, possibly the best introductory DL course available. Having attended several others (both online and in-person), I found this one to be minimalistic yet comprehensive, offering depth within its simplicity. Credit goes to Alex Aklson.
- The course from which you'll likely learn the most is "PyTorch Basics for ML". It's simply outstanding and the one I found most enjoyable.
- The Capstone Project presented a real-life use case involving ATM machine cash recognition. The goal was to design and train a network capable of automatically classifying inserted currency. Students could choose between using Keras or PyTorch; I opted for the PyTorch implementation.
